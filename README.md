# Parallel-Sumo
A multithreaded C++ and python implementation to parallelize SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility).

# Requirements
SUMO (with home environment variable set), C++ compiler, python3, METIS
SUMO routes must be explicit for every vehicle, and does not yet support additionals (taz, detectors).

# How to use
Edit the main.cpp file with the host server, port, path to the SUMO config file (with all other SUMO files in same path), and desired number of threads. Compile with the command 'make main', and run the main executable.
